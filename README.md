# GO API Example

## Overview
Being new to golang there wasn't a whole lot of complete examples out there. This aims to be a nice restfull golang api, that can get you started.  

Throughout this API i tried to avoid global objects & make each function as functional as possible.  
Trying to have every function, explicitly have everything it needs as arguments.
